Here is my new repository which builded with React Native Framework for making the User Interface in JavaScript syntax, see my previous repository about [ExpressJS - Simple Note App RESTful API](https://github.com/andreferi3/ExpressJS-Simple-Note-App-RESTful-API/) for the backend side and making API.

### What is React Native ?
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_Native)

### Why using React Native ?
6 main reason why me using React Native for make a mobile app :

1. It's got iOS and Android covered
2. Reusable components allow hybrid apps to render natively
3. Apply React Native UI component to an existing app's code-without any rewriting at all
4. It’s one of the top mobile JavaScript frameworks among developers—and growing
5. React Native is all about the UI
6. Native app development is much more efficient

### How React Native works ?
Short explanation about **How React Native Works**.

React Native invokes Objective-C APIs to render to iOS components, or Java APIs to render to Android components. This sets React Native apart from other cross-platform app development options, which often end up rendering web-based views.
